You can create the following File Template to generate the files automatically.

## For Abstract Parent -
![img.png](Images/img.png)

## For Main Method Class - 

![img_1.png](Images/img_1.png)

## For the readme with the same file name 
 
 - you can simply set that as a child template with $FileName as your identifier

Now when you try to solve a new leetcode problem 

- create a package 
- the option for the template should come up in the menu

![img_2.png](Images/img_2.png)

- This will give you the following popup

![img_3.png](Images/img_3.png)

- The files are then auto-generated in the package
